# Contributing to Forms

Following these guidelines helps to maintain quality throughout the project, however
they are not rules, so use your best judgement and feel free to propose any changes to this document.

## Submitting Issues

* You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/eredi93/jom/issues/new).
* Include as many details as possible while describing your issue (e.g. Python version).

## Submitting patches

* Include unittests if your patch is supposed to solve a bug, and explain clearly under which circumstances the bug happens. Make sure the test fails without your patch.
* Try to follow PEP8, but you may ignore the line-length-limit if following it would make the code uglier.
